Description: Distributed time series database with no external dependencies
 InfluxDB is an open source distributed time series database with no external
 dependencies. It's useful for recording metrics, events, and performing 
 analytics. It has a built-in HTTP API so you don't have to write any server
 side code to get up and running. InfluxDB is designed to be scalable, simple
 to install and manage, and fast to get data in and out. It aims to answer
 queries in real-time. That means every data point is indexed as it comes in
 and is immediately available in queries that should return in < 100ms.
